  - '...'
  - Wait.
  - I've got it now.
  - The corpses, the dead people with my same blood.
  - They must be my ancestors.
  - So was that grenade, that flash of light really there?
  - Wait, I have the best idea.
  - "I\u2019ll send you back in time to stop it."
  - It was a time after grenades were made, but cities still existed.
  - I will send you to stop the evil thrower of the grenades.
  - Failure is not an option.
  - 'Eradicate them at all costs. '
