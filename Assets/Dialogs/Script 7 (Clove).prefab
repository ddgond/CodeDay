  - A grenade.
  - It was a flash of light that killed them.
  - It was a twirl, a hot storm that felt cold to the eye.
  - "But the funny thing is, I can\u2019t even recall where I saw it."
  - I had never even met these once-living people...
  - '...yet I had a strange connection with them...'
  - '...as if I was the water vapor that was once the essence of their blood.'
  - They were in a strange little hamlet too...
  - '...a quaint suburb of a large city.'
  - "It must\u2019ve been back when cities existed..."
  - '...before we discovered how to fit houses into boxes.'
  - But I want them to live.
  - "I don\u2019t know why, I just do."
  - I can feel my blood turning to smoke...
  - '...and even as I speak, I am disappearing.'
  - "I\u2019m sure that flash of light is the culprit."
  - "I can\u2019t even remember who I am, myself."
  - Do you, Curio?
